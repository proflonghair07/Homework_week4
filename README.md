## This multiple choice quiz is made using three different files. An index html file, a css stylesheet, and a javascript script file.

## Aside from linking to the css and JS files the index page links to goooglefonts and to bootstrap. The top bar is made scalable by utilizing one of bootstraps nav-bars. The rest of the page is made up of various divs that are either shown or hidden by various functions in the javascript. Buttons are rendered using the button tag and displayed text is rendered using p tags. All elements manipulated by javascript contain unique id's.

## The css file is pretty straight forward. It sets all font to Lato by utilizing the \* selector. There are several different tag selectors. A button:hover selector is used to change the color of the the buttons when the user hovers the mouse over the button. Only one class selector is used and that is the container class and this because it is not manipulated by the javascript. The majority of the selectors are id selectors.

## The javscript file begins by creating variables that call to html elements via their id's. The questions for the quiz are all contained in an array called questionsArray. Next come the functions. All of the functions render to the proper divs using the style.display property to hide or show specific divs. The generateQuestion functions is where the questions are rendered to the questionsDiv and answers are rendered to the answer buttons using the innerhtml property. It pulls the questions from the questions array and an if statement makes it show the score if all questions have been answered. The startQuiz function calls the generateQuestions function to start the quiz. The timer is contained in the this function as well. There is an if conditional in the timer that makes it stop if it gets to zero and execute the displayScore function. The displayScore function stops the timer and shows the users score in the gameoverDiv using innerHTML and the score variable. The highscore function links the the submitButton using an event listener. This function is how the user submits their score to local storage by entering their initials. There is an if statement that doesnt allow the user to input a blank value for their initials. This if statement also writes the text "Cannot leave initials blank." to the displayError div. An else statement contains the script that saves the score to the local storage using JSON.parse. JSON.stringify is used to convert the score to a string and the generateHighscores function is called to display the high scores. The generateHighscores function clears current high score list and generates a new one from local storage. It uses JSON.parse to pull the high scores from local storage. it uses a for loop to render the scores. The scores are genereated as list tags using document.createElement. The showHighscore function shows the high score to the user by hiding and showing the appropriate divs and calling the generateHighscores function. The clearScore function clears the score from local storange and changes highScoreInitialsDisplay and highScoreScoreDisplay text content to empty. The restart function restarts the quiz hiding and show the appropriate divs, and return the values of timeLeft, score, and currentQuestionIndex to their initial values. The checkAnswer fucntion determines if the users input is correct or wrong. It sets correct by calling on the questions index. An if statement checks if the answer is correct and the quiz isnt over to add 1 to the score, display a horizontal rule and the text "Correct!" to the displayCorrect div, and move to the next question in the question index. An else if statement checks if the answer is correct and the quiz isnt over to subtract ten from the timer, display a horizontal rule and the text "Wrong!" to the displayCorrect div and move to the next question in the index. An else statment calls the function displayScore.
